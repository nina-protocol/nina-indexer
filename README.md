## 1. Indexer

The Indexer consists of a Postgres Db and a Processor that periodically checks the [on-chain Nina Program](https://github.com/nina-protocol/nina/tree/main/programs/nina) and ingests the updates.  It does this in two loops:

1. Changes to Release, Hub, HubRelease, HubPost (frequency: every minute)
2. Changes to Collectors (frequency: every hour)

>Note: Updating Collector information requires a premium RPC connection in order to call `getProgramAccounts` on the Solana Token Program

### Setup

- Copy contents of `.env.example` to `.env` - this includes a default `SOLANA_CLUSTER_URL` for Genysys Go's Public RPC which will be enough to handle (1.) above, but not (2.)
- Setup a Postgres db and replace details in `.env` with your configuration
- `yarn`
- `yarn start:indexer`

>Note: The Indexer can be run as a standalone process

---

## 2. API

The API is a simple Koa app that connects to the Postgres Database used by the indexer.

###Setup

- After setting up the Indexer as described above:
- `yarn start:api`

## 3. Docs

- The docs are built using [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) and adhere to the [OpenApi Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0)'
- Docs can be visited at [here](http://api.docs.ninaprotocol.com/)
- `yarn docs` runs the documenation for local development
