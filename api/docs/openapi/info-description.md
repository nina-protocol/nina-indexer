# OpenAPI Specification

The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which

allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
of the service without access to source

code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can 

understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
implementation logic. Similar to what

interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
guesswork in calling the service.
